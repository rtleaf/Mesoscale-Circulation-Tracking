# Mesoscale-Circulation-Tracking

Origniated and modified from https://github.com/grantdadams.

The project directory code contains a number of functions (and a script) that serve to extract and sytnthesize sea surface height data:

1. download.SEALEVEL_GLO_PHY_CLIMATE_L4_REP_OBSERVATIONS_008_057
2. Extract.nc.2.raster.AV.1DAY
3. condense.SA.1DAY.1MON (script)
4. stack.crop.nc.2.raster.SA (script)
5. Mesoscale Circulation Tracking (lightly modified from Adams' to use data from the above sripts and functions)

\center From Adams': "This code takes geotiff SSH data in the form of a RData rasterstack and identifies areas of cyclonic and anti-cyclonic regions and their respestive border regions following the methodology of Domingues et al. (2016)." The output is a rasterstack labelled "mesoscale.features.raster.stack" and a rasterstack of the geostrophic velocities labelled "geostrophic_velocity.RData". "

The features are labeled as: 1 = cyclonic region, 2 = cyclonic boundary region, 3 = common waters, 4 = anti-cyclonic boundary region, 5 = anti-cyclonic region.
